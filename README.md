LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

🧾 Overview

The Library Management System is a simple C++ project designed to manage books in a library.
It allows the user to add, display, search, update, and delete book records stored in a file.
This project demonstrates the use of file handling, classes, and object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in C++.

⚙️ Features

➕ Add New Book – Enter book ID, title, and author.

📖 Display All Books – View a list of all stored books.

🔍 Search Book – Find a book by its ID.

✏️ Modify Book Record – Update details of an existing book.

❌ Delete Book – Remove a book record permanently.

💾 File Handling – Data is saved in a text file so it persists after closing the program.
